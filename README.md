## Project Description

### Application for R Peak Detection and EOG Removal in EEG Signals

For my university course's final project, I designed a sophisticated application that significantly enhances the analysis of biomedical signals, particularly focusing on electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) data.

### Key Features

1. **R Peak Detection**:
   - The application allows users to detect R peaks in ECG signals using three distinct methods. Users can select their preferred method based on the specific requirements of their analysis:
     - **Method 1**: Provides a robust detection algorithm ideal for noisy signals.
     - **Method 2**: Offers a balance between detection speed and accuracy.
     - **Method 3**: Optimized for high-resolution signals requiring precise peak detection.

2. **EEG File Processing**:
   - The application can import EEG files directly from the user. It then processes the signals to remove Electrooculogram (EOG) artifacts, particularly those present in the FP1 and FP2 channels. This step is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the EEG data by eliminating noise introduced by eye movements.

3. **EOG Peak Detection**:
   - Beyond artifact removal, the application also identifies and marks the peaks of EOG signals within the EEG data. This dual functionality ensures that both the integrity and the detailed analysis of the EEG signals are maintained.

### Technical Specifications

- **User Interface**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface allowing seamless method selection and data processing.
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Implemented using optimized algorithms to ensure fast and accurate processing.
- **Data Compatibility**: Supports various standard EEG and ECG file formats, ensuring broad usability across different datasets.

### Conclusion

This application stands out by offering a comprehensive solution for ECG and EEG signal analysis, addressing both peak detection and artifact removal. It is an invaluable tool for researchers and clinicians in the fields of biomedical engineering and neuroscience, facilitating more accurate and efficient data analysis.
